      "_________________Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "\"Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.\"\n",
      "\"The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.\"\n",
      "\"Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.\"\n",
      "\"The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems.\"\n",
      "\"These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.\"\n",
      "\"Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.\"\n",
      "\"Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.\"\n",
      "\"The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it.\"\n",
      "\"There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.\"\n",
      "\"Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\"\n",
      "_________________UCLA\n",
      "1. UCLA was established in 1881 as a normal school, then known as the southern branch of the California State Normal School. This is incorrect, UCLA was founded in 1919. \n",
      "2. The University of California, Berkeley is the oldest campus in the University of California system. This is not necessarily true, while Berkeley is indeed the oldest campus, the University of California title was first designated to what is now known as the University of California, San Francisco.\n",
      "3. UCLA student-athletes have won 270 Olympic medals: 136 gold, 71 silver and 63 bronze. This indicates that UCLA-affiliated athletes won a total of 270 medals, but when you add the stated amounts of gold, silver, and bronze medals they total to 270 not 270 gold, silver, and bronze combined.\n",
      "4. UCLA is the most applied-to university in the United States. This is potentially incorrect information and it varies from year to year.\n",
      "5. UCLA has been represented in every Olympics since the university's founding (except in 1924) and has had a gold medalist in every Olympics in which the U.S. has participated since 1932. This might not be true because UCLA does not compete as an institution in the Olympics; rather, individual athletes from UCLA compete.\n",
      "6. UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley. This may not be entirely accurate as academic decisions typically do not depend on intercampus competitions.\n",
      "7. In 2018, a student-led community coalition known as \"Westwood Forward\" successfully led an effort to break UCLA and Westwood Village away from the existing Westwood Neighborhood Council and form a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council, with over 2,000 out of 3,521 stakeholders voting in favor of the split. This could be potential misinformation, as the affirmation of these events would require direct sources from UCLA or Westwood Forward campaign confirming the facts.\n",
      "8. In 2022, UCLA signed an agreement to partner with the Tongva for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus. This included land use for ceremonial events and educational workshops and outreach events - This might need verification based on UCLA's official announcements and agreements with the Tongva.\n",
      "_________________Rain\n",
      "1. The article states that the steam locomotive was invented in the United Kingdom in 1802, which is incorrect. The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by George Stephenson, an English engineer, in 1814.\n",
      "2. The mention of \"the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1802\" by an undeclared inventor is incorrect. The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by George Stephenson in 1814.\n",
      "3. The first passenger train was not the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, it was the Swansea and Mumbles Railway in 1807.\n",
      "4. The claim that Richard Trevithick powered the first ever steam train in 1804 is incorrect. He built a railway steam locomotive in 1804, but it was not used for a regular passenger service.\n",
      "5. The article wrongly states that trains were used to transport over 400 passengers at up to 13 kilometers per hour (8 mph) on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. The railway was initially built to transport coal.\n",
      "6. The claim that railroads first arrived in Japan in the early 1870s is incorrect. The first railway in Japan opened in 1872.\n",
      "7. The term \"'Railway Mania' started across the United Kingdom\" is misleading. This expression is used to refer to the speculative frenzy in Britain in the 1840s, not the moment when railways were first introduced. \n",
      "8. The claim that \"World War II brought great destruction to existing railroads across Europe, Asia, and Africa\" is too broad. While it's true that the war led to significant damages, it didn't affect all the railroads across these continents identically.\n",
      "9. The article's assertion that steam locomotives were used to haul mainline trains as late as 2005 in Inner Mongolia is incorrect. The last steam locomotives for industrial operation were used in China until 2021. \n",
      "10. The statement \"high speed rail networks were developed across much of Europe and Eastern Asia\" is misleading. Not all countries in these regions have developed high-speed rail networks.\n",
      "11. The claim that the first high-speed rail service was the Japanese Shinkansen, which entered service in 1964, doesn't mention that the Turin-Rome high-speed railway started its services in Italy in 1962.\n"
